## Hi there! 👋 
## I'm Imran, an aspiring data scientist.
Driven by my passion for data analysis, I thrive on turning complex datasets into meaningful insights. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

#### About Me 📊
I am a data enthusiast with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. With over 3 years of experience in IT, I began my career at Infosys in Hyderabad, specializing in implementation support with Unix, SQL, and Excel. During this time, I discovered my knack for data analysis and decided to pursue this exciting field.

At Infosys, I worked extensively with Excel to generate reports, track progress, and manage tickets efficiently. I also used SQL to extract and analyze data, writing optimized queries that improved monitoring of end-of-day processes and saved valuable time. To further enhance my data visualization skills, I learned Power BI and completed several business projects that demonstrate my ability to present data clearly and effectively.

I am eager to apply my technical skills and analytical mindset in a dynamic environment, helping organizations make data-driven decisions.
